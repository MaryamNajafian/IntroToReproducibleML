In the attached folder you will find:

Jupyter notebook with a model to predict Survival in the Titanic (we built it in the Assignment in section 2)

A script to download and prepare the titanic dataset: load_and_save_dataset.py

Template scripts for:

config.py

preprocessors.py

pipeline.py

train_pipeline.py

predict.py

Your task is:

Run the script load_and_save_dataset.py, from the same folder where you have all the above scripts, to download and save the titanic dataset

Read the Jupyter notebook to familiarize yourself with the code you need to prepare for production

Complete the config.py, preprocessors.py, pipeline.py, train_pipeline.py and predict.py with the code from the notebook

Run train_pipeline.py

Run predict.py

If you were successful, you should see the following output:

test accuracy: 0.6832



The scripts have been pre-filled to make things a bit easier.

Good luck!

Questions for this assignment
Did you manage to create Scikit-learn compatible transformers and fit them within a pipeline? Did you manage to reproduce the model in the Jupyter notebook?
